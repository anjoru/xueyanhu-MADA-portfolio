For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning.
